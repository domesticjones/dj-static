        I took over creative direction for Boise Underground Music Pages in December of 2017.
        My first issue came out in January of 2018 and has been going strong ever since and working collaboratively with Boise organizations like Treefort Music Fest and Wizardâ€™s Comic Con.

        Creating an equally engaging and living website was an important part of the brand and identity of BUMP.
        I integrated Google Sheets into an events calendar as well as a template for importing events directly into the magazine for print.

        Updating the business and booking systems required a modification of policy and procedure documents along with some basic brand guides to be established.
        Part of my duties on the board of the Boise Hive is event management and I handle the branding, coordination, and management of the annual MayDay! Event.

      descriptionMore: '
        The Hive is an entirely-volunteer run organization, so keeping processes as simple as possible for everyone is vital.
        I streamlined the booking software for the end-user as well as for the volunteer maintaining customers at The Hive.
        Since the implementation of my system, The Boise Hive has become completely self-sufficient with reservations alone.

        DecisionInsite provides comprehensive mapping and plotting software for educational planning entities.
